Revisiting objects again on JavaScript by taking a look at the challenges available on freeCodeCamp.com. 

> Objects are filled with unordered data and organised into key-value pairs. Keys can be of any data type. 

> If a key does not have special characters then you don't need to use quotation marks. 

> The values are also referred to as properties and functions are referred to as methods. 

A quick example of a basic object includes: 
```javascript 
let dog = {
	name: "Spot",
	numLegs: 4
};
```
**Accessing properties**  
There are two ways to access properties: **dot notation** and **bracket notation**. 
```javascript
let dog = {
	name: "Spot",
	numLegs: 4
};
```
