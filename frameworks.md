[^1] *Laravel - an open source PHP web framework*

A lot has happened since my last post and I have to admit it's been particularly difficult juggling the bootcamp, side projects I'm trying to complete and find time to blog. 

One of the biggest obstacles I've found, I'm placing too much emphasis on trying to write "good" content but to the detriment of starting. I have a backlog of blog ideas but keep pushing the writing to one side to prioritise coding and want to find a better balance. So I'm going to opt for shorter posts but on a more consistent basis. 

## What's happened so far... 

In the past six weeks, we've covered **a lot** of content, including: 

- [x]   JavaScript 
- [x]   The DOM
- [x]   Tooling, e.g. Git & Gulp 
- [x]   OOP PHP 
- [x]   Laravel Blade 
- [x]   Laravel APIs

I also spotted a great idea on Twitter called the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge and opted to participate and try to set aside at least an hour every day to contribute to project work. 

Creating something independently, I find, really helps my understanding of a subject and provides a great opportunity to explore an area a bit deeper. It's tricky to commit to it every day because of the bootcamp workload but some is better than none. You can check out what I've done so far on GitHub [here](https://github.com/daniel-norris/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md). 

## Getting to grips with Laravel    

The past two weeks have been spent developing a basic full stack application on the LAMP stack. We were introduced to a tool called [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) which we used to setup our development environment and at the end of the two weeks deployed the app to our own [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances using an automation deployment tool called [Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com/). You can find a copy of the repository on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/daniel-norris/laravel_setup). 

What I found really suprising was how much of the legwork, a framework like Laravel, covered in respect to routing, authentication, MVC's, migrations and testing. 

My preconceptions of how difficult it would be to develop something like an API were a lot different to my experience of doing it with the support of a framework. Which is not only encouraging but probably a bit of a relief too. I'm interested in exploring how less mature frameworks like `Express.js` achieve similar things and want to look at this at a later date.
